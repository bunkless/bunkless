# Hi there, my name is Bahna David Beniamin 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm from Europe. I'm a huge fan of front-end development, especially React.js, JavaScript, open-source, and writing testable software 💻. When I'm not crushing bugs or building dreams, you can find me playing volleyball 🏐, paintball 🔫, snowboarding 🏂, swimming 🏊‍♂️, or spending time with my beautiful girlfriend Elisa ❤️.


## 🔭 I'm currently working on becoming a better version of myself as a developer — learning new things, improving every day, and staying open to new opportunities. 

## 🌱 I'm currently learning and growing in **front-end development**, while exploring **full-stack development** to broaden my skills and open new opportunities. 


## 👯 “I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in React.js

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with exploring new technologies, code reviews, and growing as a developer.
